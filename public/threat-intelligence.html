      <h2 id="live-dashboard">Free Threat Intelligence Dashboard</h2>
      <p>CVEPulse operates a <a href="/threat-dashboard.html">free real-time threat intelligence dashboard</a> powered by live data from CISA KEV (actively exploited vulnerabilities) and Ransomware.live (ransomware victim tracking). The dashboard provides continuous visibility into the global threat landscape with features including:</p>
      <ul class="feature-list">
        <li><span class="check">✓</span> <strong>Threat posture scoring</strong> — dynamic risk score (0–100) based on active ransomware campaigns, exploited vulnerabilities, and threat actor activity</li>
        <li><span class="check">✓</span> <strong>CISA KEV vulnerability feed</strong> — real-time tracking of known exploited vulnerabilities with remediation deadlines</li>
        <li><span class="check">✓</span> <strong>Ransomware victim tracking</strong> — live feed of ransomware victims with group attribution, sector classification, and geographic data</li>
        <li><span class="check">✓</span> <strong>IoC enrichment engine</strong> — look up any IP, domain, hash, or email for threat context and MITRE ATT&CK mapping</li>
        <li><span class="check">✓</span> <strong>Emerging threat alerts</strong> — automatic detection when critical vulnerabilities or ransomware surges emerge</li>
        <li><span class="check">✓</span> <strong>Campaign intelligence</strong> — (Pro) active threat campaigns with attribution, TTPs, and targeted sectors</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="ioc">Indicators of Compromise (IoC) Enrichment</h2>
      <p>The CVEPulse IoC enrichment engine accepts any indicator — IP address, domain, file hash (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256), URL, or email address — and returns comprehensive threat context. Results include risk scoring, associated threat actors, MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping, campaign correlation, and historical sighting data. Community users receive 3 lookups per day; Professional and Enterprise plans include unlimited lookups with API access for SIEM integration.</p>

      <h2 id="cve-tracking">CVE Intelligence: Trending, Critical & Emergency CVEs</h2>
      <p>Staying ahead of vulnerabilities requires more than CVSS scores. CVEPulse tracks trending CVEs, newly published CVEs, CISA KEV entries, and emergency/zero-day CVEs in real-time. Our intelligence platform correlates CVE data with active exploitation evidence, ransomware campaign usage, and threat actor targeting to identify which critical and high CVEs actually pose risk to your specific environment. The result: true risk-based prioritization rather than alert fatigue from CVSS-only scoring.</p>

      <h2 id="threat-actors">Threat Actor & Ransomware Group Intelligence</h2>
      <p>CVEPulse maintains continuous intelligence on active threat actors, APT groups, and ransomware operations. Our tracking covers threat actor TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, targeted sectors and geographies, campaign timelines, and historical attack patterns. For ransomware specifically, we track group activity in real-time with victim data from Ransomware.live, providing sector-specific risk assessments and early warning indicators.</p>
